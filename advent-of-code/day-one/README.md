# Day 1

Part 1: Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.

Part 2: Find 3 entries that sum to 2020


## Questions from Day 1 ###

Am I correct in thinking that my solution has the follow O()?
- two nums sum to 2020 : O(n^2)
- three nums sum to 2020 : O(n^3)

What would the space complexity of my solution be?
