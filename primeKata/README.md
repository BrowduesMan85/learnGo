# PrimeFactors Kata

Write a function which accepts an integer and returns a list of integers. The list should contain all of the prime numbers that when multiplied together are equal to the number.

## What I learned

- go has a native test library `testing`
- to test `go test -v`
- code coverage `go test -cover`
  
## What I still don't understand

- Should I have used `make` to allocate the initial array instead of the slice idea?
- Why does my coverage only suggest that 90% of statements were covered? It seems that all paths were covered.
